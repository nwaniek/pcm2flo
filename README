pcm2flo converts pcm files containing optical flow information to the
more commonly used middlebury .flo format. As both file types only
differ in their file header, the tool essentially reads the pcm file
header, checks correctness and writes the data back to a flo file.

PCM file:
	PC
	w h
	max_val
	u0v0u1v1...unvn

FLO file:
	PIEH
	wh
	u0v0u1v1...unvn

As my data is restricted to be correct FLO data (flo assumes values
larger than 1e09 to be unknown optical flow), there is no check for the
max_val argument and value limits.
